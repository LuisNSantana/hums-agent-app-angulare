- Implement reactive patterns with Angular Signals
- Follow single responsibility principle for each component
- Use dependency injection for service communication

### Styling Approach
- SCSS with BEM methodology for maintainable styles
- Modern responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Dark/light theme support
- Smooth animations and transitions

### State Management
- Angular Signals for reactive state management
- Service-based state management pattern
- Immutable data handling
- Efficient change detection

### Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Comprehensive unit testing with Jest
- E2E testing with Cypress
- Proper error handling and logging

## ü§ñ AI Chat Features

The application should implement:
